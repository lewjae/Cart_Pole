### Cart_Pole

#### Description
To learn more about Reinforcement Learning for controlling a dynamic system, an inverted pole on the cart problem from OpenAI Gym is tried out. Its purpose is to establish a benchmark for future Reforcement Learning developemnt and get familiar with OpenAI Gym interface.

The main alogrithm cames from:

#### Method
It is a linear state feedback control with discrete output, 0 or 1.
Feedback gains are selected randomly, but it works surprisingly well.

#### Instruction
To run the program,
`python randomRL.py`
